# Open Distro for Elasticsearch ODBC Driver

ElasticsearchODBC is a read-only ODBC driver for Windows and Mac for connecting to Open Distro for Elasticsearch SQL support.

## Specifications

The driver is compatible with ODBC 3.51.

## Using the Driver

The driver comes in the form of a library file:
    elasticsearch.dll for Window
    libelasticsearch.dylib for Mac

If using with ODBC compatible BI tools,refer to the tool documentation on configuring a new ODBC driver. Typically, all that's required is to make the tool aware of the location of the driver library file and then use it to setup database (i.e Elasticsearch) connections.

### Connection Strings and Other Settings

To setup a connection, the driver uses an ODBC connection string. Connection strings are semicolon-delimited strings specifying the set of options to use for a connection. Typically, a connection string will either:

1. specify a Data Source Name containing a pre-configured set of options (`DSN=xxx;User=xxx;Password=xxx;`)
2. or configure options explicitly using the string (`Host=xxx;Port=xxx;LogLevel=ES_DEBUG;...`)

The following are the driver options that can be configured using a DSN or connection string:

(**NOTE:** All option names are *case-insensitive*.) 

#### Basic Options

| Option | Description | Type | Default |
|--------|-------------|------|---------------|
| `DSN` | **D**ata **S**ource **N**ame used for configuring the connection. | string | |
| `Host` / `Server` | Hostname or IP address for the target cluster. | string | |
| `Port` | Port number on which the cluster's REST interface is listening. | string | |

#### Authentication Options

| Option | Description | Type | Default |
|--------|-------------|------|---------------|
| `Auth` | Authentication mechanism to use. | one of `BASIC` (basic HTTP), `AWS_SIGV4` (AWS auth), `NONE` | `NONE`
| `User` / `UID` | [`Auth=BASIC`] Username for the connection. | string | |
| `Password` / `PWD` | [`Auth=BASIC`] Password for the connection. | string | |
| `Region` | [`Auth=AWS_SIGV4`] Region used for signing requests | AWS region (eg. `us-west-1`) | |

#### Advanced Options

| Option | Description | Type | Default |
|--------|-------------|------|---------------|
| `UseSSL` | Whether to establish the connection over SSL/TLS | boolean (`0` or `1`) | false (`0`) |
| `HostnameVerification` | Indicate whether certificate hostname verification should be performed for an SSL/TLS connection. | boolean (`0` or `1`) | true (`1`) |
| `ResponseTimeout` | The maximum time to wait for responses from the `Host`, in seconds. | integer | `10` |

#### Logging Options

| Option | Description | Type | Default |
|--------|-------------|------|---------------|
| `LogLevel` | Severity level for driver logs. | one of `ES_OFF`, `ES_FATAL`, `ES_ERROR`, `ES_INFO`, `ES_DEBUG`, `ES_TRACE`, `ES_ALL` | `ES_WARNING` |
| `LogOutput` | Location for storing driver logs. | string | WIN: `C:\`, MAC: `/tmp` |

## Download and Installation

The driver will be available through standard open source repositories for installers.

### Building

Please refer to the [build instructions](./BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS) for detailed build instructions on your platform.
If your PC is already setup to build the library, you can simply invoke cmake using

> cmake ./src

From the projects root directory, then build the project using Visual Studio (Windows) or make (Mac). To build in Visual Studio, open ./global_make_list.sln. To build for Mac, simply enter

> make

### Testing

**NOTE**: Some tests in ITODBCConnection will fail if a test DSN (Data Source Name) is not configured on your system. Refer to "Running Tests" in the [build instructions](./BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS) for more information on configuring this.
