# Open Distro for Elasticsearch ODBC Driver

ElasticsearchODBC is a read-only ODBC driver for Windows and Mac for connecting to Open Distro for Elasticsearch SQL support.

## Specifications

The driver is compatible with ODBC 3.51.

## Using the Driver

The driver comes in the form of a library file:
    elasticsearch.dll for Window
    libelasticsearch.dylib for Mac

If using with ODBC compatible BI tools,refer to the tool documentation on configuring a new ODBC driver. Typically, all that's required is to make the tool aware of the location of the driver library file and then use it to setup database (i.e Elasticsearch) connections.

### Connection Strings and other Settings

To setup a connection, the driver requires a ODBC connection strings. The connection strings are of the form:

>1. DSN=my_dsn;Username=my_username;Password=my_password;
>2. Host=host_name;Port=port_number;Username=my_username;Password=my_password;

* **DSN**: String that has an associated data structure used to describe a connection to a data source.
* **Host**: Hostname or IP address of the target cluster.
* **Port**: Port number on which the cluster's REST interface is listening. Default value depends on the scheme selected. For http, the default is 9200. For https, the default is 443.
* **Username**: Connection username.
* **Password**: Connection password.
